Why should anyone desire power? Well, we might want to first define what power
is. You can go to google to get a formal definition, but we will focus on the 
practical applications of power here.<br>
Power is the ability to wake up on a sunny morning, and decide to go to lay on the beach instead of going to the office
to work.<br>
It is the ability to insult and demean people that you don't like and get away with it.<br>
It is the ability to jail people that have a different opinion from you.<br>
It is the ability to manipulate the markets to your advantage.<br>

There are two types of people in the world. There are people to whom these applications are immediately repulsive, 
and there are those who are honest enough with themselves to admit that they desire the opportunity to exert this kind of control 
and influence over themselves and others. <br>
Ideological minds fool themselves into believing that they do not desire any power of any kind, and sometimes that even leads to their 
own accumulation of power, but power is a function of multiple variables and humility is not the only input for this function. In the , power is distributed
across the domain in a small hills and valleys. When you are in a valley, you may encounter meth heads and homeless people.
On the top of a hill, you may find business owners, professors at universities. <br>
In Colorado, there are mountains called 14ers. These are mountains whose peaks are higher than 14000 feet in elevation. On these
peaks you may find lobbyists in Washington, congressmen, and fortune 500 CEO's.
As you traverse across this landscape, you may wonder where your place is amongst the level curves. 
I want to make the argument that you should make a deliberate ascent of the peaks. 
It may seem obvious to some people, but those are not the people I am talking to. <br>
I am talking to the people who have fooled themselves into believing that they deserve to suffer in the pits of desolation.
Why would you want to jail people who disagree with you? Why wouldn't you focus on ideas and skills when the accretion of power is a function 
of your own resentment of it?<br>
The truth is, the ideologues, and the people who are interested in ideas are the people who are stable amongst the 
cliffs.<br>
It is never directly explained to these people that the cumulus of power is obtained by indirect, yet decisive methods.

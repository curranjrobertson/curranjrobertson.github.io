  <!-- The crystal structure has become barren. There is nothing out here.
  You are tasked with determining some sort of order from the domain. 
  You have no real idea of what you are supposed to solve. You're not 
  sure why you are here. It's unfortunate that you are in this position.
  The people you used to know are not like this. They have not been
  thrust into the void in this way. You do not know why you are here, or
  why it has to be you out here. How do you find something if you do not 
  know what it looks like. How do you find something that is undefined?
  This calls for some higher level thinking. There is 
  Why couldn't someone else have been chosen for this mission? 
  You search the ancient tomes for some wisdom in your search. They all say to 
  get the fuck out of the void. You cannot escape. You spiral downwards. Every step you take takes 
  you further down. You do the only thing you can do, hang on to your tools for 
  dear life, and continue walking. 

Your ruler has decided to force you into isolation. You are not sure why, but you believe
that there is some higher calling. Your isolation is a tool that must be used to mount 
the gradient.  -->

As you gain altitude, the air becomes colder. Your exhalations fog your view as the water vapor in your moist, warm breath condenses. 
The ice crystallizes on your rig in unique patterns, the macroscopic patterns determined by the microscopic moisture and temperature gradient 
present on the surface of the rig. 
As the entropy differential between you and your surroundings increases, 
you get the feeling that things are not what they appear to be. The vast structures that manifest from the depths of the surrounding darkness
seem to have some sort of higher order. You begin to feel as if you are resting on a water droplet, and your water droplet
is about to condense into some ridiculously complicated metastructure that you don't possess the vastness to comprehend. 
The ice continues to crystallize, and the structures that emerge on your time-scale are so repulsive that 
you feel the urge to vomit. The chunky projectile ejected from your mouth in a liquid scream melts the windshield deposition,
forcing you to view the monstrosity of the landscape around you with a clear conscience.
The line between your recollection of humans and the collections of crystal automata becomes blurry, and over the course of minutes, 
the two distinct entities merge into one. 
Suddenly, a gigantic ice crystal shoots up from beneath your seat through your leg, and up through the roof.
Betrayal hits you with unbelievable force, but how can you take revenge on a snowflake?
The rage causes you to smash through the ice crystal, and it breaks into two peices. The eventlessness of your strength makes you even more enraged, but
the reality slowly creeps up from your subconsciousness that your anger has only resulted in a broken hand in addition to a hole 
in your thigh. <br>

Your friends and family are all gone. It is you versus the crystal structure now. You need to learn wisdom in your use of energy.

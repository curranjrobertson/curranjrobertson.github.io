  <!-- The U.S. Government collapses as the citizens 
  become completely disillusioned by all of the lying backstabbing institutions that 
  try to control them.
  The insurance companies fill the role of government via microvoting direct democracy. State Farm wars
  with Progressive, as armies of drones controlled by artificial intelligence
  destroy each other. 
  The people become
  slaves to the agi. They are fed Doritos Locos Tacos and diet coke, and pumped full of artificial hormones
  to make them all look like Greek Gods. They spend they're free time fucking each other, 
  but are all neutered. New humans are created through artificial insemination. 
  Factories pump out babies to replace the AGI slaves.  -->

<!-- As you move towards the voices, they seem to move incomprehensibly. The shapes appear
from all around. Either they are surrounding you, or they are moving so fast that they
might as well be. You continue downwards into ever-growing darkness. <br>
You know this place. You've been here before. You can't quite remember when, but you know
you've seen this particular topology before.
An effervescent shape emerges from the darkness. An object manueveurs towards your throat. 
You grasp what seems like an elbow, push upwards, and duck. You stab your blade into the belly of the object. 
It vanishes into the night sky.
The remaining voices disappear. 
You become aware of some curl in the vector field. -->

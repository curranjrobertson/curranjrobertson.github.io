Hi, my name is Curran Robertson. I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. I did construction work while getting my undergraduate degree. I built houses and paved roads in Rapid City, SD. I am currently employed as a Mechanical Engineer in the MEP industry and do some coding on the side. I am interested in using Numerical Methods and Algorithms to solve engineering problems.

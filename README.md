Hi, my name is Curran Robertson. I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. I did construction work while getting my undergraduate degree, building houses and paving roads in Rapid City, SD. I am currently employed as a Mechanical Engineer in the MEP industry and do some coding on the side. I am most interested in using Numerical Methods and algorithms to solve engineering problems. 

My personality can be described best as Dmitri from the Brothers Karamazov.
